**Paleoceanography**
My research interests encompass paleoclimatological reconstructions of the intertropical zone, on late Cenozoic sediment records. I use planktonic foraminifera as the main climate proxy recorder.

**Ecology and biodiversity of plankton**
We work on the ecology of planktonic foraminifera mainly, from the FORCIS project funded by the FRB CESAB.
Anthropogenic CO2 emissions led to oceanic warming, and a decrease in surface water pH. Such ocean acidification (OA) is known to affect calcifying plankton groups, a key component of the carbonate pump. Fossilized shells of planktonic foraminifera comprise a major carbonate flux to the deep sea, which makes understanding their dynamics vitally important to decipher in a rapidly changing global climate. Historical changes in planktonic foraminiferal assemblages have not yet been synthesized globally, despite numerous individual collection efforts. The FORCIS project is filling this critical gap with a global synthesis compiling diversity and abundance of planktonic foraminifera with modern digital tools of data management and analysis. FORCIS assesses census counts and hydrographic data since the early 1950’s to yield insights into key biodiversity metrics over the past decades. Our project has shown that these organisms are responding to anthropic environmental changes using different strategies, depending on their main life mode (e.g. heterotrophic vs. symbiotic bearing). Our synthesis also provides a solid benchmark to improve eco-physiological and population dynamics models. The ultimate FORCIS goal is to understand the importance of main stressors such as temperature and OA that govern species distribution and calcification processes, with focus on present and near-future ocean impacts.

**Micropal robotics & software**
* MiSo : Microfossil Sorter. This large scale fully automated sorting machine, developed with ATG Technology, with a patented separation process, allows the z-stacked imaging of particles from coarse fractions (150µm-2mm), and single-particle separation into single microtubes based on imaging neural networks techniques.
* 3D printer+camera : this low cost system allows the z-stacked image acquisition of single particles.

Our in house software include :
* *MiSo controlling software : this software fully controls the MiSo automaton. This software is licensed to ATG Technology.
* Particle-Trieur : this software allows the image annotation from any source of imaging device, managing the associated metadata, CNN constructions, morphological tools, etc.
* Sashimi controlling software

**Oceanographic cruises**
I have joined more than 15 oceanographic cruises, and I am involved in two main projects including a transpacific cruise to recover sediment record along an Est-West transect to reconstruct past ENSO dynamics.
