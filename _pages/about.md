I am a paleoceanographer, working on mineralizing planktonic organisms as indicators of oceanic environments. My overarching research goal is to better constrain the processes involved in tropical climate processes (ENSO, monsoon) on long term time scales. 

For this goal, I work mainly on planktonic foraminifera, some zooplanktonic organisms. I combine modern studies of forams from plankton nets with sedimentary studies to understand the drivers of the ecology of forams, and reconstruct past environmental changes from their assemblages, geochemistry, traits. I am interested in developing new tools to automate the recognition and sorting of the planktonic shells. 

Get in touch if you want to join the group. We might have opportunities from undergrad to post-doctoral fellows, and very keen to integrate engineers in the group.
